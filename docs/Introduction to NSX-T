The Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) is defined by server virtualization, storage virtualization, and network virtualization. Server virtualization has already proven the value of SDDC architecture by reducing costs and complexity of compute infrastructure. VMware NSX-T Data Center addresses the third critical pillar of SDDC, extending the same benefits obtained from the virtualization of compute to the datacenter network. NSX-T accelerates the provisioning of core network and security services, simplifying operations and improving economics.
With network virtualization, the functional equivalent of a network hypervisor, NSX-T reproduces the complete set of Layer 2 through Layer 7 networking services (e.g., switching, routing, firewalling, and load balancing) in software. It allows these services to be programmatically assembled in any arbitrary combination to produce unique, isolated virtual networks in a matter of seconds. NSX-T also provides a platform for various security services â€“ both network and endpoint based. NSX-T provides various built-in services, including L2-L7 firewall and contextual-based security. Additionally, security vendors can leverage its Guest Introspection and Network Introspection frameworks to deliver service chained next-generation firewall, IDS/IPS, agentless anti-virus/anti-malware, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability management capabilities.
